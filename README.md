# Camunda DDD and Clean Architecture

An example to show how you could use clean architecture and DDD and their advantages with Camunda.

## üöÄFeatures

The [BPMN process](assets/processes/loan_agreement.png) which start a [second process](assets/processes/cross_selling_recommendation.png) via message correlation should represent a tiny business process just to demonstrate the architecture.

### üõ´Start the process

With the following POST request, you could start the process:

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/loan/agreement/1 \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '
  "customerNumber": "A-11",
  "name": "Tester",
  "mailAddress": "tester@web.io",
  "amount": 1100
}'
```

Using the admin user (`username: admin` and `password: pw`) you could log in to the Camunda Cockpit.

## üèóArchitecture

The following sections contain some small aspects explaining the advantages of Domain-driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture.

### Clean Architecture

One main advantage of clean architecture is the independence of any framework. Due to this fact the architecture allows (and by using the [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)), compared to the conventional layer-architecture, exchange for example your Camunda Framework. So you could migrate to Camunda 8 without even touching your business code.

Flexibility around your domain (e.g., switching from Camunda 7 to Camunda 8) is the main focus I want to show you in this little example.

Using clean architecture as architecture style combines perfectly with Domain-driven Design because we completely focus on our domain, as shown in the image by placing it in the center.

### Domain-driven Design

Using clean architectures as architectural style does specify how you should structure your domain core (entities and use cases). 
In my opinion, Domain-driven Design (DDD) perfectly combines with clean architecture due to the fact that DDD is focused on your business domain. 
Focusing on your domain is supported by the goal of clean architecture, keeping the domain free of any framework or technologies. 
E.g. your domain does not focus on how to persist something, it just tells the outgoing port to save it. 
The implementation of the port (placed on the adapter layer) decides to use, e.g., relational or non-relational databases.

Beside the matching goal of DDD and clean architecture, DDD tries to help you build complex designs around your domain,
by e.g., building immutable objects that know all about their invariants, which helps you even more to structure your code.

DDD Elements like Aggregate Entities and ValueObject can be found in our [domain-primitives](https://github.com/domain-primitives/domain-primitives-java) library.

Structuring your code functional and brining more context to your object with, e.g. Value Object does not only help you to keep your code expressive, it also helps keeping it close to your business as your BPMN model.
